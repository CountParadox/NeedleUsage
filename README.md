SO I picked up a bunch of old analog meters from a HAM fest recently and I want to use some to display system usage on my PC :)

This code is my colleague and I working out how to control them properly!

Hopefully its useful for someone.

The NeedleUsage.ino code takes a number over serial and moves the meter accordingly.
